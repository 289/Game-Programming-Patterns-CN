Sequencing Patterns
============================

Videogames are exciting in large part because they take us somewhere else. For a few minutes (or, let’s be honest with ourselves, much longer), we become inhabitants of a virtual world. Creating these worlds is one of the supreme delights of being a game programmer.

One aspect that most of these game worlds feature is time — the artificial world lives and breathes at its own cadence. As world builders, we must invent time and craft the gears that drive our game’s great clock.

The patterns in this section are tools for doing just that. A [Game Loop](03.2-Game Loop.md) is the central axle that the clock spins on. Objects hear its ticking through [Update Methods]((03.3-Update Method.md)). We can hide the computer’s sequential nature behind a facade of snapshots of moments in time using [Double Buffering](03.1-Double Buffer.md) so that the world appears to update simultaneously.
